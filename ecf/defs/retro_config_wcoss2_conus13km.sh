# Sample settings for an RRFS_CONUS_13km retro on WCOSS2.
#
# It is retro_config_wcoss2_na3km.sh with DOMAIN (and RUN_SMOKE) set, which in turn is
# the Ursa sample (retro_config_ursa_na3km.sh) with WCOSS2 locations, account and server; the
# retro period and suite settings below the input data block are the same. Link or copy it to
# ecf/defs/retro_config.sh and change the paths and server in the first blocks to your own.
#
# This is the ecflow equivalent of the Rocoto workflow's ush/config.sh, for the parts we control.
# It is sourced by ecf/setup_ecf_links.sh, ecf/defs/make_rrfs_retro_def.sh,
# ush/prod_clone/make_retro_def.sh and ush/retro/start_retro.sh, so edit values here instead of
# passing them on every command line. Anything already set in the environment wins, so one-off runs
# can still say e.g.
#
#   RETRO_START=20240510 ./make_rrfs_retro_def.sh
#
# What is NOT here, because the suite reads it at run time rather than at generation time:
#   fix/workflow/<WGF>/workflow.conf   job resources (NNODES_*, PPN_*, TPP_*) and science switches;
#                                      setup_ecf_links.sh copies the _prod or _dev version per
#                                      RESOURCE_CONFIG and applies the machine and retro overrides
#   versions/run.ver                   software versions used by the job cards
